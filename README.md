Python Modules

A Python module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. 
A module can define functions, classes, and variables. A module can also include runnable code. 
Grouping related code into a module makes the code easier to understand and use. It also makes the code logically organized.

We usually organize our files in different folders and subfolders based on some criteria, so that they can be managed easily and efficiently. 
For example, we keep all our games in a Games folder and we can even subcategorize according to the genre of the game or something like this. 
The same analogy is followed by the Python package. 

A Python module may contain several classes, functions, variables, etc. whereas a Python package can contains several module. 
In simpler terms a package is folder that contains various modules as files.

Let’s create a package named mypckg that will contain two modules mod1 and mod2. To create this module follow the below steps – 

Create a folder named mypckg.
Inside this folder create an empty Python file i.e. __init__.py
Then create two modules mod1 and mod2 in this folder.
